### What I learned

While working on this project, I learned how to effectively use CSS variables to define reusable values and modify them dynamically using JavaScript.

To see how you can modify CSS varibles with JS, see below:

```js
document.documentElement.style.setProperty(
  "--theme_background",
  themeObj[`theme_${val}_background`]
);
```
